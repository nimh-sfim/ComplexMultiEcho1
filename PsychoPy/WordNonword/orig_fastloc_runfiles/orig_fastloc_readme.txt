This directory contains the stimulus files for runs for older versions of This
script. Since these might be useful references, we decided to keep them slightly
more accessible.

The fastloc_run?o.xlsx were some of the originally received runs (I think).
faseloc_newrun*.xlsx are the runs that were used for the earlier study
at NIH with Dan Handwerker & Ramya Varadarajan
